#TO DO#
#######
# [] When touching the ground, type of jump determined by whether or not player is looking above a certain angle.
# [] Trigger dialog when the player looks at an NPC.
# [] When condition is no longer met, such as lookaway and/or timer, close dialog.
# [X] Do something about the excess inertia when player is hitting a wall but not grabbing it, or even go
#  into a decelerating wall-slide when grabbing the wall. This could add some challenge to the whole thing.
# [] fix 471
# [] I think touchdown() is okay to lose at this point
# [X] we're back to flying! seems like this branch is all about movement now. whoops.
# [X] jump is fixed
# [] slide on walls instead of fully self-arresting
# [] make sparks fly from the direction of whatever wall the player is in contact with
